### Brian Whiting - @ForsakenElite08
---

Hi, my name is Brian Whiting. I am a front-end web developer and UI/UX Designer based currently in Colorado, USA. I have a passion for design and coding - which started in 2005 in middle school for me. Currently I am a freelance dev and designer that works with mostly small to medium scale businesses and non-profit organizations. Always eager to learn something new when possible, when my kids are able to let me focus. Besides that I am a nerd/geek for tech, art, games, and Dad Jokes.

### How I Work


Music, music, music. I have to have music while working to help me focus and get in a groove. But besides that I work by doing research on the type of project first and then letting my creativity flow. Coding I will tend to zone out and focus, so if  I am too into my work then I will be looking like a man on a mission.
